## Iris Image Classification Network
In this project, I use a MLP to classify images in the Iris dataset, hosted on sci-kit-learn. I first create a bare-bones model, then regularize it using a variety of techniques, including batch normalization, dropouts, and different callbacks. This results in less overfitting and better results during validation.
